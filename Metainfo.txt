Description:   		'Estimates and plots the empirical pricing kernel 
			 (EPK) for historical index and option data 
			 (code applicable only for calls) of the DAX.  
			 The historical density is estimated by simulating a 
			 GARCH process which is chosen according to the index 
			 data. To estimate the state price density nonparametric 
			 regression is used.' 	     

Keywords:      		'black-scholes, option-price, state-price-density,
